# Name: createCategories.sh
# Purpose: used to read in a list of categories from a CSV file and create them in the JSS
# 
# **** The CSV file needs to be saved as a UNIX file with LF, not CR ****
#
# A good portion of this script is re-purposed from the script posted in the following JAMF Nation article:
# https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/discussion.html?id=13118#respond
#
# Usage: createCategories.sh apiuser apipass path-to-csv-file

# Variables
args=("$@")
jssAPIUsername="${args[0]}"
jssAPIPassword="${args[1]}"
jssAddress="https://your.jss.com:8443"  # <-- make sure to put your JSS address here
